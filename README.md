# Design-2---Project-3-Digital-Thermometer

The objective of this project is to build a thermometer using a LM35 temperature sensor and a PIC16F690 microcontroller that will
measure the ambient temperature in the range of 0°C to 99°C and display the ambient temperature
on a 2 digit, seven segment display. The temperature measurement must be instantaneous and
continuous.
